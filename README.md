# Statistic-Calculator

Inputs let's firstly talk about the simple side, "the inputs" 
the programme takes as inputs the number of table cases (N) after that takes N couples of inputs xi and ni, That's all 

# Little mathematics explanations

if you are studying statistics in your school or university, so this little programme will help you to calculate
and complete the statistic table. firstly if you did't understand what i'm talking about; i will explain:
From the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample.
For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes,
then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic.
The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter. A parameter is a number that is a property of the population.
Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.

we take a population of a data, and we organize each value (xi) and the number of her occurrence (ni) and organize them In ascending order in a table 
like this:
